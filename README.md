# Netflix-Recc-System
Employed PCA analysis, QR decomposition, and K-means clustering to develop a Netflix Recommendation System that enhances movie recommendations based on genre.
Utilized tools such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, dimensionality reduction (PCA), matrix factorization (QR decomposition), and clustering (K-means). 
The recommendation function outputs personalized movie recommendations by leveraging these methods, ensuring users receive relevant suggestions within the same genre cluster.
